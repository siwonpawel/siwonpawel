### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Java programmer mostly focused on Spring / Spring Boot backend applications and I'm learning Angular to become fullstack-developer.  

Currently working on [>my new project<](https://github.com/siwonpawel/todoapp) that I've started some time ago. Do you have an idea that fits this project well? Feel free to fill an issue ðŸ“«

I'm looking to colaborate on some frontend projects too!
